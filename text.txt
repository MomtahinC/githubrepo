    <h2>Overview of GitHub</h2>
    <p><img src="images/githublogo.png" width="1027" height="1027" alt="Silhouette of a cat's head" title="GitHub Logo" class="left">GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content. GitHub allows multiple developers to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time. With GitHub, developers can build code, track changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously. Non-developers can also use it to create, edit, and update website content, which Carpenter demonstrates in her tutorial.</p>
    <h3>What Else About GitHub?</h3>
    <p>When starting a project using issues and project boards, write your content on external word processors or via Google Docs, and then, save these files to their respective project boards. These steps allow developers and content creators to have a master copy of the file(s), thus helping them track changes over the course of a project. In addition, developers should consider downloading GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop allows users to do everything that could be done on GitHub’s web interface, but locally on a user’s machine. GitHub is built to be a collaborative interface. By allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and requiring cross-team approval for pull requests, GitHub not only allows for, but encourages collaboration within design teams. This type of collaboration can help produce a higher level of quality control.</p>
